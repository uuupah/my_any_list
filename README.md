edit mode is used for creating new entries and modifying existing entries.

myanylist is still a work in progress, and many features are still planned to be added, including:
  - hiding of empty input fields and the addition of new fields for more details in each entry
  - a five star rating for each entry
  - better entry deletion logic
  - a media type table, allowing users to separate their entries by media type (books, film, video games, etc)
